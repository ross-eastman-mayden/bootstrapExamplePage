                        Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the
                        most
                        popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little
                        book
                        that
                        comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

                        Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a
                        comic,
                        you
                        know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero.
                        And
                        most
                        times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David?
                        Because
                        of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
